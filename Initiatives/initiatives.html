The aim of the blood donation camp is to promote the donation of blood and spread awarness to help serve the mankind. Blood the fluid of life is RED regardless of the race or belief or colour. The ready availability of Blood of all kinds during emergency can save lives.
India annually needs 12 million units of blood , but our blood banks can offer only upto 9 million units of blood. That makes it a shortage of 3 million units. We at technival , are trying our bit to decrease the gap by holding camps. Come be a part of the initiative!

The students of National Institute of Technology (NIT) Goa organised a one day session of technical talks, TECHNIX in A. J. Almeida public school, Ponda. The promotional event was organised as a social initiative of TECHNIVAL, the annual technical festival of NIT Goa. The session consisted of three talks. A session on semiconductors was conducted by Ms. Shobha Singh, followed by one on Image Processing by Mr. Deepak Pradhan. The kids learned a lot about the way semiconductors are used in daily life and were fascinated to know that their favourite game "Pokemon Go" is a direct application of image processing. The students were very enthusiastic about the robotics session conducted by Mr. Eeshaan Vernekar and Mr. Nalla Naga Raju. The robotics talk also consisted of the presentation of  robots made by the college students. The entire session was about 2 and a half hours long. The students had a great time learning about the applications of these beauties of science and are looking forward for more such events.
